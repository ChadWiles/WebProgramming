Assessment 1 for Web Programming by Chad Wiles - 103564240
body.css and header.css did not work out, attempted something I did not need to do.
Reviewed how to use div/span/ul/li and it made it SUPER easy
Finding the right use of padding for the tables to make it look as if it was 3 different sections was difficult; could have done more.
